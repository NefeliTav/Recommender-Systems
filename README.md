# Recommendation-System
I tried all prediction algorithms offered by the Surprise library, (Basic, k-NN, Matrix Factorization) and then i compared different configurations for KNNBaseline and SVD.

# Pagerank
I created a graph of Pokemon and computed the Topic-Specific Pagerank for a different topic each time, using the Networkx library. Also, i proved that this procedure builds teams not simply by aggregating teams generated from individual nodes.

#Communities
Using the same Pokemon graph, i found the local communities around them, using Personalized Pagerank.
